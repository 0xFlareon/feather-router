## Getting Started

Add the package using NPM, Yarn, or the package manager of your choice!

```bash
npm install feather-router
```

```
yarn add feather-router
```

## Feather Router API

Feather Router provides a set of components and hooks that enable you to manage navigation and routing logic in your React application.

### Components

**Summary**

- `<Router />` is a top level component which wraps `<Route />` components. It handles the logic of rendering the correct child `<Route />` for the current browser path.
- `<Route />` components define what content is displayed when a particular URL is accessed.

**API**

### `<Router />`

A top-level routing component that manages client side navigation by rendering child `<Route />` components based on the current browser path.

> **Tip**: Browser path refers to the unique, last part of a URL.
>
> - The URL `www.example.com` has a browser path of "/"
> - The URL `www.example.com/about` has a browser path of "/about".

All child `<Route />` components must be nested within a parent `<Router />` component.

```jsx
import { Router, Route } from "feather-router";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
      <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- If the user navigates to `www.example.com`, the `HomePage` component is rendered.
- If the user navigates to `www.example.com/about`, the `AboutPage` component is rendered.

### `<Route path="" component={} />`

The Route component defines the React component that should be rendered for a given browser path.

> **Tip**: A `<Route />` component must be nested within a parent `<Router />` component!

- `path` is a **required property**. It is a string which represents the browser path of the `<Route />`. It must start with a forward slash `/`.
- `component` is **an optional property**. It is the React component that will be rendered if the browser path matches the path specified by the `<Route />`

`<Route />` components can use wildcard **dynamic segments** in their path to match anything. The syntax for creating a dynamic segment is a colon `:property_name`.

> **Example**: `<Route path="/user/:id" component={UserPage} />`

In the above example, browser URLs such as:

- `www.example.com/user/foo`
- `www.example.com/user/bar`
- `www.example.com/user/bazz`

Will all match the path specified by the example `<Route />`. The value of the dynamic segment (foo, bar, bazz) is extracted from the URL, and will be passed as a property to the `UserPage` component. The name of the property in this example is `id`.

When you create a dynamic segment, Feather Router uses the text after the `:` (colon) as the property name. A path can have multiple dynamic segments.

`<Route path="/:foo/:bar/:baz" component={MyComponent} />` will pass properties named `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` to `MyComponent`.

`<Route />` components can also be nested within other `<Route />` components.

```jsx
import { Router, Route } from "feather-router";

function App() {
  return <>
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" component={HomePage}> /> // A
      <Route path="/blog"> // B
        <Route path="/:blog_id" component={BlogPage} /> // C
        <Route path="/new" component={NewBlogPage} /> // D
      </Route>
    </Router>
  </>
}
```

In this example:

- `www.example.com` matches route A.
- `www.example.com/blog` matches route B. Since no component was provided, nothing is rendered.
- `www.example.com/blog/new` matches route D.
- `www.example.com/blog/57` matches route C, and provides a property named `blog_id` with value "57" to component `BlogPage`.

```jsx
function BlogPage({ blog_id }) {
  return <>
    <h1>Welcome to Blog #{blog_id}</h1>
  <>
}
```

Did you notice that `www.example.com/blog/new` matched route D, even though it met the criteria for route C as well? In the event of multiple routes matching a browser path, Feather Router will favour **static routes** over **dynamic routes**.

> A static route is a route that does not contain any dynamic segments. A dynamic route is a route that contains dynamic segments.

### Hooks

- `useRouteParams` provides a direct way to access the dynamic parameters that are matched by the current URL.
- `useBrowserPath` provides a straightforward means of modifying and retrieving the current URL path.
